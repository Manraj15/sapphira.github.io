        Invest in your smile and book with us to get Triple White Smile! The treatment takes 60 minutes including 3x20 minutes sessions and is expected to increase by 6-12 shades. The amount of whitening varies from client to client. Sapphira Laser uses a hybrid gel from House of Smiles! House of Gel whitening gel is 100% safe for your enamel and for any dental work you have had (fillings, bridges, crowns, etc.). The gel we use is approves by the FDA and Health Canada. We recommend clients see their dental hygienist every 6 months and have a dentist check every year to ensure good oral health.

        How It Works?
    </h6>
    <p>
        Our treatment involves an hybrid (a mix of carbamide peroxide and hydrogen peroxide) and a blue LED light. The LED light activates the gel and acts as an inhibitor to open pores of the teeth so the peroxide can break down stain in the dentin layer of the teeth. All sessions are completed in one appointment. The nurse will apply gel on teeth and have you sit under a LED light for 20 minutes. After each session under the LED light, you will rinse with water and then repeat the process 2 more times. During time of your appointment the nurse will also go through post treatment care instructions.

        We also send our clients home with a House of Smiles smile stick which is Hybrid Peroxide Whitening Pen for free. It is a similar composition to the gel we use in our studio; the Smile Stick is a hybrid whitening gel with a lower concentration of peroxide to make it safe for home use.
