                How it works?
            </h6>
            <p>Soprano Ice by Alma uses a unique technology which combines Alexandrite 755nm wavelength along with low maintenance of the diode laser. It’s a medical procedure that uses concentrated beam of light (laser) to remove unwanted hair. The exposure to pulses of laser light destroy the hair follicle which will result in no regrowth of hair. Laser hair removal is permanent when the hair is destroyed, when the hair is only damaged, the hair will eventually regrow. This technology only works on dark pigmented hair and is unable to treat grey, white, blonde or any other hair colour other than black.</p>
            <p>Number of treatments varies from person to person. It may take minimum of 6 or more to see results. Although you may require several treatments for long-lasting results, you may see a difference in the thickness of hair after each session. You must be consistent with your treatments in order for you to see long-lasting results. For full face an interval of 4 weeks is recommended in between session and for an interval for 6 weeks is recommended for body. During your initial complimentary consultation, the nurse will explain this more thoroughly including pre-and post-treatment care.</p>
