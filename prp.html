        PRP; Platelet Rich Plasma, is blood plasma that has been enriched with platelets. The aim of the use of Platelet Rich Plasma in Aesthetic Medicine is to improve the quality of the dermis, skin colour and texture as well as increase dermal hydration and the thickness of the skin, promoting skin regeneration in the sire of imperfection and preventing the recurrence. The best thing about PRP is its natural healing; your body provides everything thatâ€™s needed for its own healing. It can be used in conjunction with micro needling (vampire facial) as well as for scalp rejuvenation (hair loss treatment). Microneedling with conjunction of plasma helps tissue regeneration and collagen production this is used correctively for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, fine lines, atrophic scars. PRP can also be injected superficially into the collagen under skin which again helps with wrinkles, fine lines, red/pink stretch marks, under eye pigmentation, hyperpigmentation.

        How It Works?

        Your blood will be drawn and collected into the Elite PRP tube by the nurse. The nurse will then place the tube in a centrifuge which will separate your plasma. Depending on type of treatment the plasma then will be injected back into the skin and/or paired with micro needling. During treatment for microneedling/ vampire facial/injections, the nurse will apply numbing cream to the area being treated and then PRP is injected or reapplied to the skin. For hair restoration, after blood is collected in a tube and spun in a centrifuge, using syringes the plasma is injected into your scalp to target the hair follicles.
