        Chemical peels also known as Chemo-Exfoliants are a non-surgical aesthetic procedure designed to maintain a youthful appearance. This treatment uses chemical agents to induce accelerated exfoliation of the outermost skin layers. It allows new and healthy skin to present itself. Chemical peels involve Keratolysis which is separation of epidermal sublayers and the sloughing off of dead skin cells. There are many benefits of chemical peels and some include that it increases cell turnover which can result in even skin tone, it also reduces pigmentation and epidermal lines, reduces frequency and severity of acne, eliminates dry, flaky skin, refines pore size etc.
